# 🔁 Java Exercise: List Reversal with ListIterator

## 📌 Description

This exercise focuses on working with lists in Java using `ArrayList` and the `ListIterator` class. The goal is to:

1. Create and populate a list with elements.
2. Create a second list.
3. Insert into this second list the elements from the first list, **in reverse order**.
4. To achieve this, a `ListIterator` object will be used to traverse the first list from end to start.

This exercise is ideal for understanding the use of `ListIterator`, list manipulation, and how to reverse the contents of a collection in Java.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project with your preferred development environment.
3. Create a `Main` class containing the `main` method.
4. Inside the `main` method, implement the logic to create and traverse lists using `ListIterator`.

## ▶️ Execution

1. Run the `main` method.
2. The program should display:
   - The original list with the entered elements.
   - The second list with the elements in reverse order.
